			Hello! My name is Bartosz and I enjoy creating things that live on the Internet. My interest in web development
			started back in 2016 when I decided to try creating a website for my friend using custom WordPress themes â€” turns
			out meanwhile I learned a lot about HTML & CSS!
		</p>
		<p>
			Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working with a variety of clients. My main focus these days
			is building accessible and responsive websites.
		</p>
		<p>Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:</p>
		<ul class='about__list code'>
			<li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
			<li>React</li>
			<li>HTML5</li>
			<li>CSS3</li>
			<li>TypeScript</li>
			<li>Next.js</li>
		</ul>
